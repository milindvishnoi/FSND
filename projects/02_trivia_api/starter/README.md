# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a  webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out. 

## Getting Started

The project is distributed into 2 parts the [./frontend](./frontend) and [./backend](./backend).

We started the full stack application for you. It is desiged with some key functional areas:

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. 
You will work primarily in __init __.py to define your endpoints and can reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup.

To understand on how to run the APIs View [./backend README.md](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. You will need to update the endpoints after you define them in the backend. Those areas are marked with TODO and can be searched for expediency. 

Pay special attention to what data the frontend is expecting from each API response to help guide how you format your API.
